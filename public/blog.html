                <h2>Introduction to Website Hosting</h2>
                <p>Website hosting is a service that allows individuals and organizations to make their website accessible via the World Wide Web. Web hosts are companies that provide space on a server owned or leased for use by clients, as well as providing Internet connectivity, typically in a data center.</p>

                <h2>Types of Website Hosting</h2>
                <article>
                    <h3>1. Shared Hosting</h3>
                    <p>Shared hosting is the most common type of web hosting. This is where a single server hosts multiple websites. The advantage is that the cost is shared among many users, making it more affordable. However, resources are also shared, which can impact performance.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>2. VPS Hosting</h3>
                    <p>Virtual Private Server (VPS) hosting is a step up from shared hosting. It uses virtualization technology to provide you with dedicated resources on a server with multiple users. It offers more control and customization options compared to shared hosting.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>3. Dedicated Hosting</h3>
                    <p>Dedicated hosting provides an entire server dedicated solely to your website. It offers high performance, security, and control. However, it is significantly more expensive than shared or VPS hosting.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>4. Cloud Hosting</h3>
                    <p>Cloud hosting is a newer type of hosting that uses multiple servers to balance the load and maximize uptime. It is scalable and allows for flexible resource management, making it ideal for growing websites.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>5. Managed Hosting</h3>
                    <p>Managed hosting is a hands-off approach where the hosting provider takes care of all technical aspects of hosting your website, including maintenance, security, and backups. This is ideal for those who lack technical expertise.</p>
